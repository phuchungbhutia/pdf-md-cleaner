7.8
The provision of Gram Panchayat Financial Rules, Budget & Accounts Manual, 2017, shall have to be

8.BUDGETING & BUDGETARY CONTROL
8.1
The section 46 of the Sikkim Panchayat Act and para 8 of Notification No. 35(159)93/RDD/P-III/33
dated 10/07/2003 envisaged that every Gram Panchayat is required to prepare Annual Budget for the next
financial year and place before the Gram Sabha after the Annual State Budget is passed by the State
Legislative Assembly.
8.2
Budgets Reflect the Wish of the People:
The concept of Panchayati Raj is about transferring power to the people. It is based on Gandhiji's
cherished vision of 'self-governing' villages. Villages have to be self-sufficient and be able to chalk out their own
agenda for development depending on the local needs. However, villages have only limited resources and a
prudent use of these scarce resources can be made only through an effective exercise of budgeting.
Acts of State Governmentgoverning the functions of Panchayats provide for a meeting of Gram
Sabha
where members are required to give suggestions regarding works to be undertaken
in
their
areas.
Gram
Panchayats are responsible for identifying development works based on suggestions made by various members
of the Gram Sabha. These works may be in various areas where the State has issued orders for devolution of
power to the Panchayats. Identifying different works based on the need of the people and in the form of
development projects in the area of jurisdiction of the Gram Panchayat and estimating the likely expenditure
required to complete each of such works, identifying the beneficiaries, availability of fund and other critical factors
are all elements of budgeting.
8.3
Budgets are about setting priorities
Budgeting would require estimating the resources. Codal provisions require a certain
percentage of
the annual receipts of the Panchayats to be left as balance at the end of the year.
Certain
activities,
like
administration of the Panchayat, are continuous and the panchayat has to find adequate funding for these
 of 65
activities. These would form the first charge on the available resources of the Panchayats. There may be
many other items of
activities or works based on suggestions received from the people on which the
expenditure
is required to be incurred from the available funds of the Panchayats. As the resources are
limited, this would require setting up a criteria for determining as to what all works/activities should be taken
up for execution during the year under consideration for which budget is to be made.
8.4
Budget is Making Decisions on Revenue and Expenditure:
Budget is a financial estimate of possible revenue that can be generated and expenditure that needs to
be incurred for a specific period generally within the financial year. It is the
annual
financial
estimate
of
possible income and expenditure. Budget making initiates
Panchayat/Gram Sabha to debate over various
options of mobilizing more resources and
finding out different development works and activities where
expenditure is to be incurred
based on people's needs. The budget making is all about making decisions
on how to
increase revenue and which works or schemes or activates or programmes the area of the
Panchyat jurisdiction are to be considered and how much each of the competing proposals
cost
and how to rank them and finally include in the budget taking into account available
spendable income and
applicable rules.
8.5
What is Budget
The Budget is a document prepared annually indicating the estimated receipts under each
source of revenue and estimated expenditure under each objects during the ensuing
financial year.
Besides, the actuals (or revised estimates) of total receipts under each source and
actuals
(or
revised
estimates) of total payments under each object during the current
financial year are also taken into account,
which can be one of the bases for projecting
estimates of ensuing year.
The variation between actuals (or revised estimates) of the current year and the estimates of
the
ensuing year are also explained. The variations between budgeted (original) and actuals
(or
revised
estimates) of receipts and expenditure of the current year are also explained.
A comparison of actuals and estimates during the last two years shall give a trend of receipts
and
expenditure and performance against the goals. This can be helpful in setting the
projected
goals
for
receipt and expenditure in the ensuing year/future.The estimates of
receipts
and
expenditure
shall
be
prepared in a realistic manner. Appropriate prioritization of
allocation
of
funds
on
various
objects
of
expenditure shall be made according to their
durability and income generating capacity.
8.6
How to Make Budget: First Phase of Making Budget:
How is the Panchayat budget to be prepared? Top down traditional method under which
budget can be
prepared by the government agency based on certain policy. Bottom up grassroots level approach is to involve
the people of Panchayat to make their budget.
 of 65
Before getting into the expenditure decisions, people of the Panchayat must know how much money they have in
Panchayat fund.
Then comes which are the development works and activities to be considered for spending.
What should be the norm for deciding the work to be included in the budget for spending?
Panchayat people must discuss different options and possibilities of increasing its resources, what are the
different needs of the people living in the Panchayat area and how to prioritize them.
Discussions may focus on what are the possibilities of raising both tax and non taxrevenues from items under
Panchayat's mandate and how prioritize the works to be included in the budget.
8.7
Second Phase: Approving Budget
Once the budgets are made, it needs approval from the competent authority. The budget proposals
should give adequate justification for accepting or rejecting an item, activity or
work proposal. The competent
authority will evaluate the estimates of possible revenues and proposals of expenditures. There may be further
questioning and intense debate on proposals for revenue and competing spending proposals. Approval process
is not just signing or passing what is made by a Panchayat in a routine way. Each process is important.
Approval of the budget provides an opportunity for evaluation of competing claims before agreeing
to
the decisions and justifications by the authority.
8.8
Third Phase is Implementation of Budget
After approval of the budget, what is important is proper implementation of the budget. Execution of the
budget is an effective method of expenditure control as well as monitoring
the results periodically. When
any expenditure is incurred from the public money, adherence to principles of economy, efficiency and
effectiveness in spending as well as the applicable
General Financial Rules and Delegation of Financial Rules.
8.9
Standards of Financial Propriety
The canons of financial propriety bring the prudential financial principles of public spending:
When public money is spent, one should exercise the same vigilance as a person of ordinary prudence in
spending his or her own money.
The expenditure should not be more than the occasion demands.
No authority must sanction expenditure to benefit him or her directly or indirectly.
No expenditure form public moneys must be incurred to benefit a particular person or a section of the people,
unless it can be enforced in a Court of Law, or 'the expenditure is in pursuance of a recognized policy or custom';
The amount of allowances granted to meet expenditure of a particular type should not be a source of profit to the
recipients.
8.10
Budgetary Control of Expenditure
Budget contains the crystallized and documented needs of the people. It embodies the
financial
wisdom. No expenditure can be incurred without provision of the same in the
budget.
Without
adequate
 of 65
Budget provision, Panchayat shall not commit any expenditure by issuing Sanction Order/Work Order. The
authority shall not issue any Sanction Order or Work Order without sufficient provision in the Budget.
In case Panchayat requires to incur additional expenditure not provided in the Budget, provision shall be
obtained through a supplementary or revised budget. The prescribed procedure should be followed how to go
for re-appropriation with the approval of the competent authority.
8.11
Supplementary or Revised Budget
In case expenditure is not provided for in the budget or there is a need to incur more funds than
provided in the budget, a supplementary or a revised budget must be passed by the Panchayat and get it
approved in the next immediate meeting of the Gram Sabha. The revised budget estimate is presented in the
month of February - March or as per the need of Gram Panchayat, or as part of the budget proposals for the
succeeding year.
8.12
Preparing budgets and maintaining accounts based on the activity/work.
It is imperative that the work programmes approved by the Gram Sabha within the framework provided
by the Constitution of India and the Finance Commission should form
the base of the budget and accounting
system. The other administrative expenditure of the
Panchayats can be captured as ‘Activities’. An exhaustive
list of these works and activities
can be prepared and each of these can be mapped to their respective
account codes through
the available software.The sample illustrative Budget Format is appended at
Annexure-XIII.
8.13
Categorization of Receipts and Expenditure: A categorization of Receipt and Expenditure
shall
be made into Revenue and Capital.
8.14
Contents of Budget: The budgets of PRIs must contain probable receipts as under:
i)
Opening balances in Panchayats’ funds
ii) Estimated receipts, inter alia, from
contribution of grants, if any, made by Central or the State Government including such part of
the land revenue collected in the State as may be determined by the government,
contribution of grants made by the other local bodies,
loans granted by the Central/State Government, local Authorities or Commercial Scheduled
Banks,
receipts from rates, taxes, fees or other sources,
iii) The estimated expenditure, inter alia, comprises
administrative cost such as payment of salaries and other allowances, wages, payment of
pension and gratuities, office expenses, purchase of furniture and fixture, office equipment,
stationery, electricity charges and other incidental charges, new item of expenditure along
 of 65
9. MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS
with reasons thereof, etc.
The above estimates must be based on expenditure incurred
during previous year allowing increases due to annual increment, increases in dearness
allowances and inflation.
expenditure on works for which estimates must be drawn with the help of Engineering
Department or indicating approximate figures on the basis of existing prescribed Schedule of
Rates.
9.1
The provisions relating to Accounts and Audit and other related issues are contained in Sikkim
Panchayat Act, 1993 in section 48 in respect of Gram Panchayat requiring maintenance of accounts of receipt
and expenditure in such form and manner as may be prescribed.
9.2
Budgets convey approval for spending within the approved limit
Budgets convey approval of the Gram Panchayat for spending funds on the approved works/activities.
Expenditure on the approved works/activities have to be contained within the estimated amount, and if
not further approval is required. The Sabhapati and Gram Sachiva are authorized to sign cheques for
withdrawing money from the banks for meeting an intended expenditure. However, this power can be
exercised only if funds are available to be spent on that particular work/activity. This is achieved through
accounting.While incurring expenditure a record of expenditure is kept what is called a ‘Voucher’. Data
contained on these vouchers are recorded in various books like cash book, Contingent Audit
Register/Ledger Accounts, register of works, Demand and Collection Register, etc.
9.3
What is Accounting?
Accounting is a process of recognizing, measuring and generating of financial information to permit
informed judgments and decisions by the users of accounts. Each Gram Panchayat is an entity which
receives and pays money from and to a number of other entities or individuals. It is important that all
these money received or spent should be recorded properly so that it should be possible at any future
date to know what has been received from whom on what account or what has been paid to whom and
why.
An entity should be seen differently from the individuals who run it. The money received by Gram
Panchayat does not belong to any individual but to the Panchayat as a whole. No individual can spend
the money the way he or she likes because the money does not belong to him or her.
9.4
Accounts of Gram Panchayats
Since the accounts of Gram Panchayats in many cases are maintained on cash basis and transactions
are recognized and recorded only when cash is paid or received, concepts of cost, conservatism etc. are
 of 65
automatically covered by cash system of accounts. With the increasing use of Information Technology in
maintenance of accounts, some of these Books of Accounts may not be maintained at all as the
computers can process the information and produce the desired reports by aggregating the information.
For less complex accounts like that of a Gram Panchayat, documents like Ledger Books can be
processed by computer. In other words, it should be possible that by entering the basic data which
would constitute “journal entries”, all other books of accounts would be prepared electronically.
9.5

process of implementation of budget estimates starts and with this the process of accounting begins as
explained below.
The process of implementation of budget estimates will involve emergence of financial
transactions affecting the flow of money into the funds of the concerned PRI from various sources of
receipts as visualized in the budget estimates. Similarly, there will also be flow of money out of the
funds on account of expenses on various activities as per the estimates anticipated in the budget
estimates. Thus, funds of the concerned PRI will either increase or decrease with every financial
transaction of receipt or payment respectively. Therefore, it is necessary that every such transaction as
and when affects the flow of fund it is recorded in the books of accounts.
2) Why are the books of accounts and financial statements necessary/important to be maintained?
The books of accounts and a summary of it (i.e. financial statements prepared periodically or at the end
of the financial year), are necessary as they will serve the following purpose:-

A PRI can compare its performance with reference to the budget estimates of that year. It can
also exercise control of expenditure against the sanctioned provision under each head of Receipt and
Expenditure as per approved Budget Estimates.
 of 65
b)
The stakeholders of PRI are interested to know -

matters of the concerned PRI.
c)
Stakeholders can also make plans for the future based on the results i.e. the financial
statements.
d)
The persons responsible for managing the activities and financial affairs of the PRI, are
accountable to the stakeholders, and the stakeholders are interested to know -
i.Whether the expenditure on each activity is as per provisions made in the budget estimates. The
progressive total of expenditure on each activity has not exceeded the budget provision for it.
ii.That expenditure on an activity is not incurred if there is no budget provision.
iii.Whether they are in a position to answer their queries from the books of accounts and summary of it i.e.
financial statements,
e)
They can also monitor amounts recoverable or payable from or to an entity or a person and
f)
Whether all the receipts and payments have been properly recorded.
g)
The concerned PRI can compare its financial performance with other PRIs of its level across
the state
h)
The State Government can compare the performance its PRIs with other States.
i)
The State and Central Governments can see that PRI has spent Tied grants only for the
purpose for which it was granted. Whether all the grants released by them have been accounted for in
the books of accounts.
