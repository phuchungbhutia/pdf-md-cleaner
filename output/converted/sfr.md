PREFACE
This new compilation of the Sikkim Financial Rules contains mainly the rules
relating to general system of financial management and control, responsibilities of
various authorities regarding withdrawal of money from public account, powers of
sanctioning expenditure, preparation of budget, purchase and handling of stores, loans
and advances to Government servants, etc.
2. The rules contained in this volume apply to all departments. Officers of the
Sikkim Public Works Department, Irrigation Department, Power Department and the
Forest Department should follow these rules supplemented by special instructions, if any,
contained in their departmental Codes or Manuals.
3. The rules and instructions contained in this volume supersede the corresponding
rules wherever exist.
4. Finance Department will be responsible to keep this volume up-to date by issue
of correction ships as and when necessary. The Accountant General and the heads of
departments are requested to bring to notice of the Finance department any error or
omission in this volume noticed by them and suggestion for corrections or additions that
may be considered necessary.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
The first edition of Sikkim Financial Rules was published in September 1979. The
limited number of copies printed at that time exhausted long back. The growing
demands from the members of Accounts Services and others necessiated publication of
this edition.
2. While doing so, opportunity has been taken to supplement a number of rules on
the basis of experience gained during the last ten years to make the rules more clear and
meaningful. Two new chapters one on security deposits and the other on destruction of
office records connected with accounts - have been incorporated. Extracts of certain
Articles of the Constitution of India which are referred to in these rules or otherwise
relevant have also been incorporated as an Appendix for ready reference.
3. Due to manifold increase in public expenditure during the last ten years
consequent on the launching of various development schemes involving large outlay, the
financial powers delegated to various authorities as incorporated in the first edition, and
amended from time to time, were found to be inadequate. Adequate powers have now
been provided in this edition. The heads of departments will also redelegate powers, with
the concurrance of Finance, to their subordinate officers at various levels to facilitate
speedy execution of development schemes.
4. Finance Department will keep this volume up-to date by issue of corrected slips
as and when necessary. Any ommission or error in the rules may be brought to the
notice of Finance Department for correction.

CHAPTER II
GENERAL SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL
I. RECEIPT OF GOVERNMENT MONEY
4. General -(I) All moneys received by or on behalf of Government shall be
brought into Government account without delay.
(2) Under Article 284 of the Constitution, all moneys received by or
deposited with any officer, employed in connection with the affairs of the State in
his capacity as such, other than revenues or public moneys raised or received by
the Government, shall be paid into Public Account of the State. All moneys
received or deposited with any Court in the State shall also be paid into the Public
Account.
5. The head of account to which such moneys shall be credited and the withdrawal
of money therefrom shall be governed by the List of Major and Minor Heads of
Account prescribed by the Government of India in consultation with the Comptroller
and Audit General of India and in such orders of Government as may be issued from
time to time.
6. Assessment, collection and check of revenues :- Subject to the provisions of
rule 50 and such general and specific instructions as may be issued by
Government, it is the duty of each department to ensure that the dues of
Government are correctly and promptly assessed, collected and paid into the
Bank.
II EXPENDITURE AND PAYMENT OF MONEYS
7. Essential conditions governing expenditure from public funds:- Subject to
the provisions of Articles 266(3), 267(2) and 283(2) of the Constitution, no
authority may incur any expenditure or enter into any liability involving expenditure
or transfer of money for investment or deposit from Government account unless
such expenditure or transfer, as the case may be, has been sanctioned by general
or special orders of Government or by any authority to which power has been
duly delegated in this behalf.
8. The mere inclusion of an item in the budget does not constitute an authority for
incurring expenditure on the particular item. Prior specific sanction of the competent
authority is necessary in each case before any expenditure is incurred or
commitment of a liability is made.
5
9. The charge in respect of a single item of expenditure may not be split up so as
to bring each part within the competence of an authority to whom powers of
sanction have been delegated. Every part or installment of the scheme requires the
approval of such authority who alone may be competent to sanction the scheme
as a whole, unless such powers are specifically delegated in any case.
10. Even if a particular scheme may have been approved and funds provided in
the sanctioned budget, expenditure on different items of any scheme, like
appointment of staff, purchase of stores, contingencies etc., can be incurred only
with the specific sanction of the authority competent to sanction such appointments,
purchase, contingencies etc.
11. Standards of financial propriety - Every officer incurring or authorising
expenditure from public moneys should be guided by high standard of financial
propriety. Every officer should also enforce financial order and strict economy at
every step and see that all relevant financial rules and regulations are observed by
his own office and by subordinate disbursing officers. Among the principles on
which emphasis is generally laid are the following :-
(i)
Every officer is expected to exercise the same vigilance in respect of
expenditure incurred from public money as a person of ordinary
prudence would exercise in respect of expenditure of his own money.
(ii)
The expenditure should not be prima facie more than the occasion
demands.
(iii)
No authority should exercise its powers of sanctioning expenditure
to pass an order which will be directly or indirectly to its own
advantage.
(iv)
Expenditure from public money should not be incurred for the
benefit of a particular person or a section of the people, unless
(1) a claim for the amount could be enforced in a court of law;
or
(2) the expenditure is in pursuance of a recognised policy or
custom.
(v)
The amount of allowances granted to meet expenditure of a
particular type should be so regulated that the allowances are not on
the whole a source of profit to the recipients.
(vi)
The responsibility and accountability of every authority
delegated with financial powers to procure any items or service on
Government account is total and indivisible. Government expects
6
that the authority concerned will have the public interest uppermost
in its mind while making a procurement decision. This
responsibility is not discharged merely by the selection of the
cheapest offer but must conform to the following yardsticks of
financial propriety :
(1) Whether the offers have been invited in accordance with
governing rules and after following a fair and reasonable
procedure in the prevailing circumstances.
(2) Whether the authority is satisfied that the selected offer will
adequately meet the requirement for which it is being procured.
(3) Whether the price on offer is reasonable and consistent with the
quality required.
(4) Above all, whether the offer being accepted is the most
appropriate one taking all relevant factors into account and in
keeping with the standards of financial propriety.
(vii)
Wherever called for, the concerned authority must place on record in
precise terms, the considerations which weighed with it while taking
the procurement decision.
12. A controlling officer shall see not only that the total expenditure is kept within
the limits of the authorised grant or appropriation but also that the funds allotted to
spending units are expended in the public interest and upon objects for which the
money was provided.
13. In order to maintain proper control, the controlling officer should arrange to be
kept informed not only of what has actually been spent from the grant or
appropriation but also what commitments and liabilities have been and will be
incurred against them. He must be in a position to assume before Government and
the Public Accounts Committee, if necessary, complete responsibility for
departmental expenditure and to explain or to justify any instance of excess or
financial irregularity that may be brought to notice as a result of audit scrutiny or
otherwise.
14. In the discharge of his ultimate responsibility for the administration of a grant
or appropriation, or a part thereof, placed at his disposal, every controlling
officer must satisfy himself not only that adequate provisions exist within the
departmental organisation for systematic internal checks calculated to prevent and
detect errors and irregularities in the financial proceedings of his subordinate
officers and to guard against waste and loss of public money and stores but also
that the prescribed checks are effectively applied.
7
III. DUTIES AS REGARDS MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS
15. Every subordinate authority whose duty it is to prepare and render any
accounts or returns in respect of public funds or stores shall be personally
responsible for their completeness and strict accuracy and their despatch within the
prescribed date.
16. A subordinate authority who signs or countersigns a certificate shall be
personally responsible for the facts certified to so far as it is his duty to know or to
the extent to which he may reasonably be expected to be aware of them.
17. The fact that a certificate is printed is no justification for an officer signing it
unless it represents the facts of the case. If in its printed form it does not represent
the facts, it his duty to make necessary amendments which will call attention to the
deviation and so to give the authority concerned the opportunity of deciding
whether the amendments cover requirements.
18. Demand for information by Audit - A subordinate authority shall afford all
reasonable facilities to the Accountant General for the discharge of his functions and
furnish fullest possible information required by him for the preparation of any
official account or report.
19. A subordinate authority shall not withhold any information, books or other
documents required by the Accountant General.
Note:- If the information, books or other documents, or a part thereof, are
of a secret nature, they should be sent by name to the Accountant General and
he will deal with them in accordance with standing instructions for handling and
custody of such documents.
IV. DEFALCATIONS, LOSSES ETC.
20. Report of losses - (1) With the exception noted below, any loss or shortage
of public money, departmental revenue or receipts, stamps, stores or other
property held by, or on behalf of Government, caused by defalcations or otherwise
including losses and shortages noticed as a result of physical verification, which is
discovered in an office or department shall be immediately reported by the
subordinate authority concerned to next higher authority as well as to the
Accountant General even when such loss has been made good by the party
responsible for it. A copy of the report should be endorsed to the Finance
Department.
8
(2) If the irregularity is detected by Audit in the first instance, the Accountant
General will report it immediately to the administrative authority concerned and if
he considers necessary, to Government in the Finance Department as well.
Exception - Petty cases, that is, cases involving losses not exceeding Rs.500
each, need not be reported to the Accountant General unless there are in any case,
important features which merit detailed investigation and consideration.
21. The officer receiving a report submitted to him under rule 20 must forwarded it
forthwith to Government through usual channel with such comments as may be
considered necessary. He should also submit a detailed report, after completing
such departmental investigations as may be necessary or expedient, on the causes or
circumstances which led to the defalcation or loss, the step taken to prevent its
recurrence and the disciplinary or any other action proposed as regards the person
responsible. The mere fact that the loss has been made good by the party concerned
is not enough to drop the matter or close the case.
22. Accidents - Any serious loss of immovable property, such as buildings,
communications or other works, caused by fire, flood, cyclone, landslide,
earthquake or any other natural cause, shall be reported at once by the
departmental officer concerned to the head of the department and by the latter
to the Government. When a full enquiry as to the cause and extent of the loss has
been made, the detailed report should be sent by the departmental officer
concerned to the head of the department, a copy of the report being
simultaneously forwarded to the Accountant General.
Note:- All losses of immovable property such as buildings, communications
etc, caused by fire, flood, landslide or any other natural cause, exceeding Rs.5,000
in value should be treated as “serious” for the purpose of rule 22. The term
“value” for this purpose should be interpreted as meaning the “book value”. Losses
not exceeding Rs.5000 in value should, however, be reported to the head of the
department; they need not be reported to the Government or the Accountant
General.
23. Sabotage - All cases of loss due to suspected sabotage or other criminal
action endangering the security of the state shall be reported to the Police
promptly irrespective of the value of the loss involved.
24. Responsibility for losses etc. - (1) Every Government servant should realise
fully and clearly that he will be held personally responsible for any loss sustained
by Government through negligence on his part in the discharge of his duties, direct
or supervisory. Any fraud is also a criminal offence, liable to be dealt with
accordingly. (2) If, in the course of investigation any defects or deficiencies in the
rules or procedures come to light, it shall be the duty of the department concerned to
initiate remedial measures.
9
V. PROCEDURE FOR PAYING MONEY INTO THE GOVERNMENT
ACCOUNT
25. Any person paying money into the Bank shall present with it a chalan in the
prescribed form showing distinctly the nature of the payment, the person or
Government officer on whose account the payment is made, and all the information
necessary for the proper account Classification of the credit. Separate chalans shall
be used for moneys creditable to different heads of accounts. The chalans shall be
presented in quadruplicate. ( See Office Memorandum No.53/Fin/Accts,
Dt.28/04/97 for Procedure of filling up of the Chalan )
26. When money is paid by a private person into a Bank located in the same place
as the departmental officer concerned in the payment, the chalan will, before
presentation to the Bank, be signed by the departmental officer to whose
account the money is to be credited. ( See Office Memorandum
No.53/Fin/Accts,Dt.28/04/97 for Procedure of filling up of the Chalan )
VI. CONTRACTS
27. General principles- (1) No contract shall be entered into by any authority
which has not been empowered to do so by the Government. The Governor
should be made a party to every contract of the Government and the words
“for and on behalf of the Governor of Sikkim” should follow the designation
appended below the signature of the officer authorised in this behalf under
Article 299 of the Constitution and executing the contract.
(2) The terms of contract must be precise and definite, and there must be
no room for ambiguity or misconstruction therein.
(3) Standard forms of contract should be adopted wherever possible, the
terms to be subject to adequate prior scrutiny.
(4) In cases where standard forms of contract are not used, legal and
financial advice should be taken in the drafting of contracts and before they are
finally entered into.
(5) The terms of a contract once entered into should not be materially
varied without the previous consent of the authority who had approved the contract
who may take prior legal and financial advice.
(6) No contract involving an uncertain or indefinite liability or any condition
of an unusual character should be entered into without previous approval of the
Government.
10
(7) Whenever practicable and advantageous, contracts should be placed only
after tenders have been openly invited. Wherever a tender other than the lowest is
to be accepted, the reasons therefor should be recorded and decisions taken
only after such reasons have been accepted by the authority competent to approve
the contract.
(8) In selecting the tender to be accepted the financial status of the
individuals and firms tendering as also their performance in similar contracts
must be taken into consideration in addition to all other relevant factors.
(9) Save in exceptional circumstances, no work of any kind should be
commenced without prior execution of contract documents. Even in cases
where a formal written contract is not made, no order for supplies etc., should
be placed without at least a written agreement as to the price.
(10) Every contract should contain suitable penal provisions against any
breach or non-fulfillment of the contract or any of its terms by the contractor.
Any waiver of the prescribed penal consequences should be fully justified in writing
and should have the prior approval of the authority competent to execute the
contract.
(11) The question whether any sales tax, purchase tax, octroi and terminal
taxes and other local taxes and duties are to be paid and if so, by which party,
should be settled and cleared before entering into any contract involving transfer
of movable property whatever its nature.
(12) Where any material is to be supplied by Government for use in the
contract work, the contract should contain a schedule specifying the quantities of
such materials along with issue rates thereof and providing for payment, by the
party concerned, of any sales or other taxes or duties that may be applicable to such
supplies.
(13) Security should normally be taken for the due fulfillment of a contract
exceeding certain monetary limit as may be prescribed by Government.
(14) No payments to contractors by way of compensation or otherwise
outside the strict terms of the contract should be authorised without consultation
with the Law Department and the prior approval of Government in the Finance
Department.
(15) Provision must be made in contracts for safeguarding Government
property entrusted to a contractor.
(16) No relaxation of specifications agreed upon in a contract or relaxation
of the terms of an agreement entered into by Government should be made without
11
proper examination of the financial effect involved in such relaxation. The interest
of the public exchequer should be taken due care of before agreeing to any
relaxation of agreement or contract.
(17) When a contract is likely to endure for a period of more than five years,
it should wherever feasible, include a provision for unconditional power of
revocation or cancellation at the discretion of the Government at any time after
the expiry of reasonable notice to that effect. The period of notice should not
normally be longer than six months.
(18) Copies of all contracts and agreement of value of rupees one lakh and
above should be sent to the Accountant General.
27(A). Maintenance Contract: Depending on the cost and nature of the goods
purchased, Maintenance Contract for a period of not less then one year has to be
signed between the Department and the Supplier/Manufacturer or any other
competent and reliable Firm. The Maintenance Contract should be comprehensive
so that the Maintenance Contract also covers the cost of spares replaced. It is to be
ensured that the equipment or the machinery is to be maintained free of cost by the
Manufacturer/Supplier till expiry of its Warranty Period.
27(B). Buy Back Offer: The Competent Authority may accord approval to replace
an existing old item(s) with a new and better version of equipment(s) in terms of
Buy Back Offer received from a reputed Manufacturer of the equipment; the
Department may trade the existing old item while purchasing the new one.
27(C). Procurement of Services: Government Departments may hire external
professionals, consultancy firms or consultants for a specific job which is well
defined in terms of content and time frame for completion of a project or out source
certain services. The hiring of a consultant may be resorted to in situations requiring
high quality services for which the requisite expertise is presently not available.
Approval of the Competent Authority shall be obtained before engaging
Consultants. The eligibility and prequalification criteria to be met by the Consultant
shall be notified through advertisement published in local and national papers. On
the basis of the responses received from the interested parties, name shall be short
listed for consideration of the Competent Authority. Number of short listed
consultants should not be less then 3(three) and the best shall be selected.
12
CHAPTER III
WITHDRAWL OF MONEY FROM GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT
I. GENERAL LIMITATIONS
28. No money shall be drawn from the Bank unless it is required for immediate
disbursement. It is not permissible to draw money from the Bank in anticipation of
demands or to prevent the lapse of budget grants.
II. MODE OF WITHDRAWAL
29. Save as otherwise specifically ordered by Government, money may not be
withdrawn from the Government Account except by presentation of bills at the Pay
and Accounts Office.
30. When a person not in Government employment claims payment for work done,
service rendered or articles supplied, such claims shall, unless there are express
orders of the Government to the contrary, be submitted through the head of the
Department or other responsible Government officer under whose immediate order
the service was done or equivalent was given for which payment is demanded.
31. Government officers may make such payments as are authorised to be paid out
of permanent advances or imprests which they are permitted to hold under orders of
competent authority subject to recoupment on presentation of bills.
32. General instructions regarding preparation and form of bills - The
following instructions with regard to preparation and form of bills shall be
observed :-
(i)
Printed forms of bills as far as possible in English should be
adopted.
(ii)
All bills must be filled in and signed in ink. The amount of each
bill should, as far as whole rupees are concerned, be written in words
as well as in figures. The fractions of a rupee may, however, be
written in figure after the words stating the number of rupees, but in
case of there being no fraction of a rupee, the word “only” should be
inserted after the number of whole rupees and care should be taken to
leave no space for interpolation as in the following examples; “Rupees
twenty six only,” “Rupees thirty five and paise 25”.
13
(iii)
All corrections and alterations in the total of a bill whether made in
words or figure, should be attested by the full signature with date of
the drawing officer as many times as such corrections and alterations
are made.
(iv)
Erasures and overwriting in any bill should be avoided; if any
correction be necessary, the incorrect entry should be cancelled
neatly and the correct entry inserted. Each such correction, or any
interpolation deemed necessary should be authenticated by the
drawing officer setting his full signature with date against each.
(v)
The full accounts classification should be recorded on each bill by the
drawing officer, the classification in the budget being taken as a guide.
The classification should also show whether the expenditure is voted
or charged (non-voted).
(vi)
Charges against two or more major heads should not be included in
one bill as the items require different action in the Pay and
Accounts Office, such as entry in different registers.
(vii)
In case of pay bills, the various sections comprising the
establishment (such as UDC, LDC, Junior Accountant, Accountant
etc.) should be shown separately the description of each section
as well as the sanctioned numbers of posts included therein being
prominently written in red ink at the top.
(viii) The entries in all the money columns of the bill should be totaled
separately under each section and the totals written in red ink. The
totals should be checked by the drawing officer himself or by some
responsible person other than the clerk preparing the bill.
(ix)
When bills are presented on account of charges incurred under any
special orders, the orders sanctioning the charges should be quoted.
Copies of sanctions accompanying a bill should be duly certified by a
gazetted officer or by a responsible subordinate specially authorised
in this behalf by the head of the office.
(x)
The space left blank either in the money column or in the columns for
particulars of the bills should invariably be covered by oblique
lines.
(xi)
A note to the effect that the amount of the bill is below a specified
amount expressed in whole rupees which is slightly in excess of the
total amount of the bill should invariably be recorded on the body of
the bill in red ink. For example, if the amount of the bill is
Rs.29.50 the words “ Below Rs.30 (thirty)” should be recorded in red
ink as a safeguard against any possible interpolation.
14
(xii)
In case of a bill passed by drawing officer/ controlling officer for
presentation at the Pay and Accounts Office but lost either before
payment or before presentation at that office, the Government officer
who drew the original bill should ascertain from the Pay and
Accounts Office that payment has not been made on it before he
issues a duplicate thereof. The duplicate copy if issued must bear
distinctly on its face the word ‘duplicate’ written in red ink. The fact
that duplicate bill has been issued shall be immediately
communicated to the Pay and Accounts Office with instructions to
refuse payment on the original bill if presented.
Note:- For this purpose the Pay and Accounts Office on receipt of a request
from any drawing/controlling officer shall, after due verification from its
records, furnish a certificate in the following form:-
‘Certified
that
Bill
No......dated.........for
Rs............(Rupees...............)
reported by (drawing officer) to have been drawn by him on this office in
favor of ........ has not been paid, and will not be paid if presented hereafter.’
(xiii) When any kind of bill is required to be prepared in duplicate or
triplicate, only one copy shall be signed or countersigned in full and
the other copy or copies may be duly initialed. Only the bill with full
signature should be presented at the Pay and Accounts Office for
payment.
(xiv) Instruction for rounding off transaction in Government Account. The
instruction is contained in Appendix 12
33. Duplicates and copies of bills etc. - No Government officer may issue duplicate
or copies of bills or other documents for payment of money which has already been
paid, on the allegation that the originals have been lost. If any necessity arises for
such a document, a certificate may be given that on a specified day a certain sum was
paid to a certain person.
34. Stamps for receipt -Reciepts for all sums exceeding Rs.20 must be stamped
unless they are exempted from stamp duty.
Note: The limit of Rs.20. up-to which a reciept is not required to be
stamped should be applied to the net amount payable on a bill and not the gross
claim preferred therein.
35. Specimen signature and other safeguards -Every Government officer who is
authorised to draw cheques or sign or countersign bills payable at the Pay and
Accounts Office/Bank shall send a specimen of his signature to the Director,
Treasury, Pay and Accounts Office/Bank through some superior or other officer
15
whose specimen signature is already with the Pay and Accounts Office/Bank. When
such an officer makes over charge of his office to another, he shall likewise send a
specimen of the signature of the relieving officer to the Pay and Accounts
Office/Bank.
III RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONEY WITHDRAWN
36. General - It is not sufficient that an officer’s accounts should be correct to his
own satisfaction. A disbursing officer has to satisfy not only himself, but also the
Audit, that a claim which has been accepted is valid, that a voucher is a complete
proof of the payment which it supports, and that an account is correct in all
respects. It is necessary that all accounts should be so kept and the details so fully
recorded as to afford the requisite means for satisfying any enquiry that may be
made into the particulars of a case, even though such enquiry may be as to the
economy or the bonafides of the
transactions. It is further essential that the records of payment must be so clear
and self-contained as to be producible as satisfactory and convincing evidence
of facts, if required, in a court of law.
37. Vouchers in support of payments -(1) A Government servant entrusted with
the payment of money shall obtain for every payment he makes, a voucher setting
forth full and clear particulars of the claim and all information necessary for its
proper classification and identification in the accounts.
Note - In case of works below rupees ten thousand sanctioned by a District
Coordination Committee to a panchayat nominee, the Pay & Accounts Office
will not insist on production of vouchers in support of purchase of cement,
timber etc. from authorised dealers. The Pay & Accounts Office will pass the bills
on production of a certificate by the nominee from the concerned officer to the effect
that the work has been duly completed according to specifications.
(2) Every voucher must bear, or have attached to it an acknowledgment of
the payment signed by the person by whom, or on whose behalf, the claim is put
forward. The acknowledgment should be taken at the time of payment.
(3) In all cases in which it is not possible or expedient to support a
payment by a voucher or by the payee’s receipt, a certificate of payment duly
signed by the disbursing officer together with a note explaining the circumstances
should invariably be kept on record.
Note 1:- In the case of articles received by value-payable post, the value
payable cover together with the invoice or bill showing the details of the items paid
for, may be accepted as voucher. The disbursing officer should endorse a
note on the cover to the effect that the payment was made through the Post Office
and this also covers the money order commission.
16
Note 2:-Cash memoranda which do not contain an acknowledgment of the
receipt of money from persons named therein cannot be accepted as receipt. Cash
memoranda will not, therefore, be regarded as sub-vouchers unless they contain
an acknowledgment of the receipts of money from the persons named therein or,
in cases where this is not practicable, they are stamped “paid” and initialed by the
disbursing officer. The cash memoranda submitted in support of the claims for
reimbursement of the cost of medicines purchased from the market under medical
rules need not, however, be stamped or bear the suppliers acknowledgment.
(4) Every voucher must bear a pay order signed or initialed by the
disbursing officer, specifying the amount payable, both in words and figures. All
pay orders must be signed by hand and in ink.
(5) All paid vouchers must be stamped “paid” so that they cannot be used a
second time.
38. The Director, Treasury, Pay and Accounts Office shall obtain sufficient
information as to the nature of every payment he is making and shall not accept a
claim which does not present formally that information, unless there are valid
reasons, which he shall record in writing, for omitting to require it.
39. An Accounts Officer of the Pay and Accounts Office may correct an
arithmetical inaccuracy or an obvious mistake in any bill presented to the Pay and
Accounts Office for payment, but shall intimate to the drawing officer any
correction which he makes.
40. First payment of pay, allowances etc. - When a Government servant present
his pay bill for the first time or when the name of a Government servant appears
for the first time in an establishment bill, the bill shall be supported by a last
pay certificate in the prescribed form; or if he did not previously hold any post
under the Government, a certificate of fitness from an appropriate medical
authority in the prescribed form must accompany the bill.
41. Payment on quitting the service - The last payment of pay or allowances shall
not be made to, or in respect of a Government servant finally quitting the service
of the Government by retirement, resignation, dismissal, death or otherwise or
placed under suspension until the disbursing officer has satisfied himself, by
reference to the Director, Treasury, Pay and Accounts Office, the departmental
authorities and his own records, that there are no demands outstanding against him.
42. Death of a payee - Pay and allowances can be drawn for the day of the man’s
death; the hour at which death takes place has no effect on the claim.
Note -“Day” for the purpose of this rule should mean a calendar day
beginning and ending at midnight.
17
43. Subject to the provisions of rule 41, pay and allowances of all kinds claimed on
behalf of a deceased Government servant may be paid without production of the
usual legal authority -
(i)
If the gross amount of the claim does not exceed Rs.2,000, under
orders of the head of the office in which the Government servant was
employed at the time of his death provided that the head of the office
is otherwise satisfied about the right and title of the claimant; and
(ii)
If the gross amount of the claim exceeds Rs.2,000, under orders of the
head of the department, on execution of an indemnity bond in the
prescribed form, duly stamped for the gross amount due for
payment, with such sureties as may be deemed necessary.
44. Overtime allowances - Subject to any general or special orders issued by
Government in this behalf, every bill in which overtime allowances are claimed
shall contain a certificate of the head of the office to the following effect:-
“Certified that-
(i)
The men for whom overtime allowances are claimed in this bill
have actually earned by working overtime;
(ii)
the periods for which overtime allowances are claimed in this
bill have been checked with the initial records and found
correct; and
(iii)
overtime allowances are claimed at rates sanctioned by
competent authority.”
45. Arrear bill - Arrears of pay, fixed allowance or leave salary shall be drawn not
in the ordinary monthly bill, but in a separate bill the amount claimed for each
month being entered separately with quotation of the number and date together
with date of encashment of the bill from which the charge was omitted or withheld
or on which it was refunded by deduction, or of any special order of competent
authority granting a new allowance or an increase in pay. A note of the arrear
bill shall invariably be made in the office copy of the bills for the period to
which the claim pertains over the dated initial of the drawer of the arrear bill, in
order to avoid the risk of the arrears being claimed over again. The drawing
officer shall also record a certificate on the arrear bill under his dated signature to the
effect that -
(i) no part of the amount claimed has been drawn previously; and
(ii) a note of the arrear claim has been made in the office copy of
the bills for the period to which the claim pertains.
18
46. Disbursement of pay and allowances - acquittance rolls -(1)The head of an
office is personally responsible for the amount drawn by him or on his behalf
until he has paid it to the person entitled to receive it, and obtained a legally valid
acquittance on the copy of the bill. If, in any case, owing to the large size
of an establishment or for any other reason, if it not found feasible or convenient
to obtain the receipts of the payees on the office copy of the bill, the head of the
office may maintain a separate acquittance roll.
(2) If for any reason, payment cannot be made within the course of the
month, the amount drawn for the payee shall be refunded by short drawal in the
next bill, his pay and allowances may be drawn anew under rule 45 when the
occasion for making the payment arises. If, however in the opinion of the head of the
office this restriction is likely to operate inconveniently, the amount of
undisbursed pay or allowances, may at his option, be retained for any period
not exceeding three months, but this concession shall not be availed of unless the
head of office is satisfied that proper arrangements can be made for the safe custody
of the sums retained.
47. Audit objections and recoveries -Every Government servant must attend
promptly to all objections and orders communicated to him by the Accountant
General.
48. When the Accountant General disallows a payment as unauthorised, the
disbursing officer is bound not only to recover the amount disallowed without
listening to any objection or protest but to refuse to pay it in future till the
Accountant General authorises the payment to be resumed.
Note 1:- If a Government servant from whom a recovery is ordered is
transferred to the jurisdiction of another disbursing officer, the order of recovery
should be passed on to that disbursing officer without delay.
Note 2:- A disbursing officer must not, when a retrenchment is ordered,
enter into any correspondence with either the Accountant General or the
Government servant concerned. It is his duty simply and promptly to carry out the
orders he has received and to leave to the person agrieved to refer the case to the
proper authority.
19
IV INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING CASH

(vi)
An erasure or overwriting of an entry made in the cash book is
strictly prohibited. If a mistake is discovered, it should be

(2). The estimates shall also distinguish provision for expenditure on
revenue account from that for other expenditure including expenditure on capital
account, on loans by Government and for repayment of loans etc.
(3). The estimates for expenditure for which a vote of the Legislature is
required shall be presented in the form of “Demands for Grants” after obtaining the
recommendation of the Governor.
Note:- The provision for charged expenditure under any head for which

expenditure under each head of account.
Explanation - As the demands for grants are for gross expenditure and the
annual financial statement gives the net amount to be expended under each head,
the totals of the two should be reconciled after adjustment of the recoveries taken in
accounts in deduction of gross expenditure.
28
73. Form of annual financial statement and demands for grants :-The form of
the annual financial statement and of the demands for grants shall be laid down by
the Finance Department and no alteration of arrangement or classification shall be

preceding years, suitably modified with reference to any changes anticipated on
account of special circumstances in respect of the year estimated for. The reason for
any such modification should be clearly noted against the item concerned, either in
the remarks column or in a separate explanatory note, with sufficient data to
justify the estimate as made.
(4) No items of receipts or expenditure should be included in the
estimates for which specific sanction or general authority does not exist.
Note : Items of receipts or expenditure which, although not sanctioned at the
time of preparation of the estimates, have already been proposed and are expected

appended to the estimate. Such items should be arranged according to the
appropriate major or minor head of the main departmental estimates and the
remarks column should draw attention to the appended note.

accordance with the following instructions -
(i)
The full expenditure on account of the sanctioned scale as on 1st
April of the year estimated for should be shown, the details of rates

the three preceding years. The estimates for contingent charges
should be shown separately under each detailed head.
(6) Pay of officers, pay of establishment and fixed allowances should be
grouped together as ‘Salaries’. Fluctuating allowances, including travelling
allowances, and contingent expenditure, should be shown separately.
III. SCRUTINY OF ESTIMATES
76. On receipt of the departmental estimates the Finance Department will subject
each such estimates to careful scrutiny and after discussion with departmental
officers, where necessary, embody the results thereof and its recommendations in
each estimate.
77. The Finance Department will thereafter consolidate all the departmental estimates
into a self-contained Budget in the prescribed form exhibiting receipts and

communicate to the administrative departments concerned the grants made and the
appropriation sanctioned by the Legislature.
81. Distribution of grants and appropriations - The administrative department
concerned on whose behalf a grant or appropriation is authorised by the
Legislature, may distribute the sanctioned funds, where necessary, among the

82. Availability of a grant or appropriation for the financial year for which it
is sanctioned - A grant or appropriation shall be utilised to cover the charges,
including the liabilities, if any, of the past year, to be paid during the financial year
or to be adjusted in the accounts of the financial year for which such grant or
appropriation is sanctioned. Such charges can be authorised by a competent
authority, any time before, but not after, the expiry of the financial year. Any
unspent balance shall lapse and shall not be available for utilisation in the following
year.
VI. CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE
83. Responsibility for control of expenditure:- (1) The administrative
department concerned on whose behalf a grant or appropriation is authorised by
the Legislature shall be responsible for the control of expenditure against the
sanctioned grants and appropriations placed at its disposal and shall exercise its
control through the heads of departments and other controlling officers, if any, and
disbursing officers subordinate to them.
31
Note :- In order to ensure that the departmental accounts are sufficiently
accurate and to render possible an efficient departmental control of expenditure,
reconciliation of figures given in the accounts maintained by the head of the
department with those that appear in the Accountant General’s books is most
essential. The head of the department and the Accountant General shall be jointly
responsible for this reconciliation which should be made monthly, the initial
responsibility resting with the Accountant General. It should be remembered
that the account finally published will be those maintained by the Accountant
General.
(2) In order that the control of departments over such expenditure may be
effective and real and that the controlling officer should be in a position from
month to month to estimate the likelihood of savings in and excess over grants and
appropriations, the Finance Department may lay down the detailed procedure for
observance by all drawing, disbursing and controlling officers concerned.
(3) For the purpose of control of expenditure, the administrative departments
of the Government should obtain form the controlling and disbursing officers
subordinate to them, monthly and progressive total figures of Plan and Non-Plan
expenditure separately. The information so obtained should be posted by each
department in a Register kept for the purpose with a view to enabling a proper
watch of total expenditure incurred against the sanctioned grant or appropriation.
(4) The administrative departments should also obtain from the controlling
officers and other authorities subordinate to them statements showing the name of
the scheme, the budget provision for each scheme, the progressive expenditure in
each scheme, the progress of the scheme in physical terms and the detailed reasons
for any shortfalls or excesses, both financial and physical. The above said data
should be analysed by the administrative departments by corelating the progress of
expenditure on each scheme to the progress of the scheme in physical terms and the
results reported to the Government for initiating remedial action promptly, where
necessary.
(5) In order to maintain proper control over expenditure a controlling officer
should obtain from the spending authorities liability statements monthly from
the month of October in each financial year which should be progressive and
should give the position of outstanding liabilities upto the month to which the
statement relates. This liability statement will be obtained in addition to the
monthly statement of actual expenditure incurred.
(6) A controlling officer should maintain a liability register in which particulars
furnished in the monthly statement should be consolidated. This will not only
facilitate the exercise of effective exchequer control and the preparation of correct
budget estimates but will also help in the elimination of cases of
excesses over grants/appropriations and of non-surrender of savings.
32
84. Surrender of savings - Departments of Government shall surrender to the
Finance Department, before the close of the financial year, all the anticipated
savings noticed in the grants or appropriations controlled by them. The Finance
Department shall communicate the acceptance of such surrenders as are
accepted by them to the Accountant General before the close of the year.
Note 1: The savings should be surrendered to Government immediately they
are foreseen without waiting till the end of the year, unless they are required to meet
excesses under some other unit or units which are definitely foreseen at the time.
No savings should be held in reserve for possible future excesses.
Note 2: Provision that cannot be profitably utilised should be
surrendered. It is contrary to the interest of the Government that money should
be spent hastily or in an ill-considered manner merely because it is available or that
the lapse of a grant could be avoided. The existence of likely savings should not be
seized as an opportunity for introducing fresh items of expenditure which might wait
till the next year.
Note 3: Rush of expenditure particularly in the closing month of the
financial year shall be regarded as a breach of financial regularity and should be
avoided.
85. Reappropriation of funds-(1) Reappropriation of funds from one primary unit
of appropriation to another such unit within a grant or appropriation shall be
sanctioned by the Finance Department at any time before the close of the
financial year to which such grant or appropriation relates.
(2) Reappropriation of funds shall be made only when it is known or
anticipated that the appropriation for the unit from which funds are to be transferred
will not be utilised in full or that savings can be effected in the appropriation for the
said amount.
(3) Funds shall not be reappropriated from a unit with the intention of
restoring the diverted appropriation to that unit when savings become available
under other units later in the year.
(4) No reappropriation shall be made from one grant or appropriation to
another grant or appropriation.
(5) The authority sanctioning the reappropriation shall enclose a copy of the
order to the Accountant General.
(6) Funds shall not be appropriated or reappropriated to meet expenditure
which has not been sanctioned by an authority competent to sanction it.
33
(7) Funds provided for charged expenditure shall not be appropriated or
reappropriated to meet votable expenditure and funds provided for voted
expenditure shall not be appropriated or re-appropriated to meet charged
expenditure.
(8) Funds provided for revenue expenditure shall not be appropriated or
reappropriated to meet capital expenditure and funds provided for capital
expenditure shall not be appropriated or reappropriated to meet revenue expenditure.
(9) Funds provided for Plan expenditure shall not be appropriated or
reappropriated to meet Non-Plan expenditure and funds provided for Non-Plan
expenditure shall not be appropriated or reappropriated to meet Plan expenditure.
(10) Funds shall not be appropriated or reappropriated to meet expenditure on
a new service not contemplated in the budget as approved by the State Legislature.
(11) Funds shall not be appropriated or reappropriated to any work which has
not received administrative approval and technical sanction as prescribed by rules
from time to time.
(12) The amount appropriated to any work shall not exceed the amount
approved or sanctioned for that work by a sum greater than the excess which may be
authorised under the rules.
(13) Since voted and charged portions as also the revenue and capital
sections of a grant/appropriation are distinct and reappropriation interse is not
permissible, an excess in any one portion or section is treated as an excess in the
grant/appropriation.
86. Supplementary grants - If the amount provided for in the sanctioned Budget
for any service in a financial year is found to be insufficient for the purpose in that
year or when a need has arisen during that year for supplementary or additional
expenditure upon some ‘new service’ not contemplated in the original budget for
that year, the head of the department concerned shall arrange to obtain the
necessary supplementary grants or appropriations in accordance with the
provisions of Articles 205(I) of the Constitution.
Note : The expression ‘new service’ has not been defined in the
Constitution. As decided by the Central Government in consultation with the
Comptroller and Auditor General of India, no attempt should be made to the
definition of it, but the matter should be allowed to be regulated by experience and
the evolution of a body of case-laws.
87. Advance from Contingency Fund - (I) When a need arises to incur
unforeseen expenditure in excess of the sanctioned grant or appropriation or
on a ‘new service’ not provided in the budget and there is no sufficient time for
34
the voting of the supplementary demand and the passing of the connected
appropriation bill, an advance from the Contingency Fund set up under Article
267(2) of the Constitution shall be obtained before incurring the expenditure.
(2) An advance from the Contingency Fund shall also be obtained to meet
expenditure in excess of the provision for the service included in an Appropriation
(Vote on Account) Act.
(3) The procedure to be followed for obtaining an advance from the
Contingency Fund shall be as laid down in the Sikkim Contingency Fund Rules,
1975 (Appendix 6), as amended from time to time.
88. Inevitable payments - (I) Subject to the provisions of Article 204(3) of the
Constitution, money indisputably payable by Government shall not ordinarily be
left unpaid and the payments made shall not be kept out of accounts longer than is
absolutely necessary.
(2) Suitable provision for anticipated liabilities should invariably be made in
demands for grants to be placed before the Legislature. The onus of proving that
the disbursements could not have reasonably been anticipated would be on the
controlling officer.
Note : It is not open to a disbursing authority to incur or authorise
payments in excess of the amounts provided in the Appropriation Act. If inevitable
payments, for which no appropriation exists in the Appropriation Act, have to
be made, an advance from the Contingency Fund should be obtained before the
expenditure is actually incurred.
VII. REVISED ESTIMATES
89. In the first week of October very year, all heads of departments will review the
progress of receipts and expenditure against the approved budget for the year
with reference to the actual for such period as may be available and prepare revised
estimates for the year. If any savings from or excess over the original estimates
are proposed, the reason therefor should be recorded in an explanatory note
which, together with the revised proposals, should be forwarded to the Finance
Department in the prescribed form not later than 31st October. Any appreciable
variations discovered in the revised figures of expenditure and receipts
subsequent to their communication to the Finance Department should be intimated
to that department as early as possible but not later that 15th January in any case.
90. On receipt of the revised estimates from all the departments, the Finance
Department will compile a consolidated statement of revised estimates for the
entire Government in the prescribed form.
91. It should be noted that the revised estimates do not constitute sanctions for
additional expenditure over the original budget and the procedure prescribed in rule
86 or rule 87 should be followed before incurring the additional expenditure.
35
CHAPTER VII
ESTABLISHMENTS
92. Alterations of establishment - The Finance Department shall be
consulted before the issue of orders upon any proposal-
(i)

post from the public service;
(ii)

95. In cases in which the transfer of charge involves assumption of
responsibility for cash, stores etc., the following instructions should be observed:-
(i)
The cash book or imprest account should be closed on the date of
transfer and a note recorded in it over the signature of both the
relieved and the relieving Government servants, showing the cash

made over and received by them respectively.
(ii)
The relieving Government servant reporting that the transfer has been
completed should bring to the notice anything irregular or
objectionable in the conduct of business that may have come
officially to his notice. He should examine the accounts, count
the cash, inspect the stores, count, weigh and measure certain
selected articles in order to test the accuracy of the returns. He
should also describe the state of the accounts records.
36
(iii)
In the case of any sudden casualty occurring or any emergent
necessity arising for a Government servant to quit his charge, the
next senior officer of the department present shall take charge.

departmental superior and obtain orders as to the cash in hand, if
any.
96. Date of birth – (1) Every person newly appointed to a service or post under the
Government shall at the time of the appointment declare the date of birth by the

recorded in the history of service, service book, or any other record that may be
kept in respect of the Government servant’s service under the Government and
once recorded, it cannot be altered, except in the case of a clerical error, without the
previous orders of the head of the department concerned.
97. Determination of date of birth when exact date is not known:- (1) If a
Government servant is unable to state his exact date of birth but can state the year,
or year and month of birth, the 1st July or the 16th of the month respectively, shall
be treated as the date of his birth.
(2) If he is only able to state his approximate age, his date of birth shall be
assumed to be the corresponding date after deducting the number of years

98. Service books - At a fixed time early in the year the service books shall be
taken up for verification by the head of the office who after satisfying himself that
the services of the Government servants concerned are correctly recorded in
each of the service books, shall record in each case a certificate in the following
form over his signature :-
“Service verified up-to (date) from (the record from which, the verification
is made)”
Note : The verification of service referred to above is intended to ensure
that the head of the office has satisfied himself that the Government servant’s entire
service, whether permanent or temporary, as recorded in the service book, is
completely borne out by actual facts.
37
CHAPTER VIII
CONTINGENT EXPENDITURE
I. CONTINGENCIES
99. Introductory - The term “contingent charges” or “contingencies” used in these
rules means and includes all incidental and other expenses which are incurred for
the management of an office as an office or for the technical working of a
department, other than those which under prescribed rules of classification of
expenditure fall under some other head of expenditure, e.g., “works”, “stores”,
“tools and plant” etc.
99-A. Responsibilities of Accounts Officers : The Accounts Officers are
responsible for strict implementation of all Financial Rules. They shall be the
Head of the Accounts of the Departments/Office and Financial Advisor to the
Secretary/ Head of Department/Head of Office. Their advice is obligatory before
sanctioning any expenditure in the Department.
NOTE: Where any discrepancy or difference of opinion arises between the
advice of Accounts Officer and that of the Secretary/ Head of Office and that of the
Secretary/Head of Department/Head of Office in respect of interpretation of these
rules or any other matter, the case should be referred to Finance Secretary whose
decision will be final and binding.
100. Responsibility of drawing officer- The drawing officer is responsible for
seeing that the rules regarding the preparation of bills are observed, that the money
is required for immediate disbursement or has already been paid from the
permanent advance, that the expenditure is within the available appropriation and
that all steps have been taken with a view to obtaining an additional appropriation if
the original appropriation has either been exceeded or is likely to be exceeded.
101. Responsibility of controlling authority - The countersigning officer shall be
responsible for seeing that the items of expenditure included in a contingent bill are
of obvious necessity and are at fair and reasonable rates, that previous sanction for
any item requiring it is attached, that the requisite vouchers are all received and are
in order, that the calculations are correct, and specially that the grants have not
been exceeded nor are they likely to be exceeded. If expenditure be progressing
too rapidly, he shall communicate with the drawing officer and insist on its being
checked.
102. Cancellation and destruction of sub-vouchers - The following rules for the
prevention of the fraudulent use of sub-vouchers shall be observed by all drawing
and controlling officers in the matter of cancellation and destruction of sub-
vouchers:-
38
(i)
Unless in any case it is distinctly provided otherwise by any rule or
order, no sub-voucher may be destroyed until after a lapse of three
years.
(ii)
Sub-vouchers attached to the contingent bills should not be
cancelled either by the drawing officer or by controlling officer, as
the duty of cancelling these sub-vouchers to prevent their
fraudulent use devolves on the Pay and Accounts Office.
103. Maintenance of contingent register - A register of contingent
expenditure shall be kept in each office and the initials of the head of the office, or
of a gazetted officer to whom this duty has been delegated by him, shall be
entered against the date of payment of each item.
104. As each payment is made, entries must be made in the contingent register of
the date of payment, the name of the payee and the number of sub-vouchers and
the amount. The progress of expenditure under each head as compared with the
appropriation for it, can be watched through this register.
II. PERMANENT ADVANCE
105. General – (1) Permanent advance of reasonable amount may be sanctioned
by the Government to heads of departments/offices to enable them to make
payments of a contingent nature before they can place themselves in funds by
drawing money through presentation of bills.
(2) As these advances involve permanent retention of money outside the
Bank, the amount of such advances must not be larger than is absolutely
necessary. All applications for the grant of permanent advance or revision of
an advance already sanctioned shall be submitted to the head of the department
who will obtain the approval of the Finance Department and issue sanctions
therefor.
(3) Permanent advances are intended to provide, on the responsibility of
the officer entrusted with it, for emergent petty advances of all kinds though it is
seldom that they will be needed for other than contingent charges.
(4) The holder of a permanent advance is responsible for the safe custody
of the money placed in his charge and he must at all times be ready to account for
the total amount of the money.
(5) Expenditure from the permanent advance may be recouped on the basis
of properly prepared and duly passed bills which shall be marked as debitable
to appropriate expenditure head. Every person holding such advances shall
maintain, in a subsidiary cash book in the prescribed form, the day to day accounts
for expenditure from these advances.
39
(6) In the case of transfer of charges and yearly on the 15th April, each
officer in whose favor the permanent advance is sanctioned shall send an
acknowledgment to the Accountant General of the amount due from and
accountable for by himself as on 31st March proceeding.
106. The number of permanent advances should not be multiplied
unnecessarily. An advance sanctioned to a head of department or office should
normally include the needs of every authority under him authorised to handle
permanent advance on behalf of the department. The head of the department or
office shall be responsible for the proper accounting of all such advances made
by him to other officers of his department.
40
CHAPTER IX
MISCELLANEOUS EXPENDITURE
I. REFUNDS OF REVENUE
107. All sanctions to refund of revenue to which claimants may be entitled under
the provisions of any law and/or rules made thereunder, or which may be made ex-
gratia, shall be regulated by the orders of the departmental authorities according
to provisions of the departmental rules and orders contained in the departmental
manuals etc. A copy of the sanction shall be endorsed to the Accountant General and
the Director, Treasury, Pay and Accounts Office. The sanction should also be
quoted in the bill.
[Government of Sikkim instuction. (Noti.No.446/Fin.Dated:31st July,1972)
The public are hereby informed that a deduction of:
12 1/2 % on the first Rs.500/-
7 1/2% on Rs.501/- to Rs.2,000/- and
3% above Rs.2,000 will be charged as establishment charges on all kinds
of refunds on account of office works done and other expenditure.
(Clarification to Noti.No.446/Fin Dated:31.07.1992)
The word ‘refund’ appearing in the 5th line of the above Notification will
not include the cases where refund is made for excess deduction of loans from
the individual’s pay, refund of deposit made by individuals way of Security Deposit,
Earnest Money, Bail Money or refund of money which are deposited on
Government orders.
2. The Establishment charges which will be deducted according to this
Notification will apply only in respect of refunds of wrong and irregular
credits.]
108. Before a refund of revenue to which a claimant is either legally entitled or
which is allowed ex-gratia, is made, the original demand or realisation, as the case
may be, must be traced and a reference to the refund should be so recorded against
the original entry in the cash book or other documents as to make the
entertainment a double or erroneous claim impossible. A certified of such a note
having been made must be given in all vouchers for refund.
109. Remission of revenue allowed before collection are to be treated as reduction
of demands and not as refund.
41
II GRANTS-IN-AID ETC.
110. The rules in this section shall be observed by all authorities competent to
sanction grants-in-aid, including scholarships, to educational and other
institutions, local bodies and co-operative societies.
Note : - In cases where financial assistance is proposed to be granted to a
society or an organisation likely to make profits, the feasibility of giving loans
instead of grants-in-aid should be specifically considered by the sanctioning
authority in consultation with the Finance Department.
111. (1) Unless in any case Government directs otherwise, every order
sanctioning a grant shall indicate whether it is recurring or non-recurring in
nature and specify clearly the object for which it is given and the conditions, if any,
attached to the grant. In the case of non-recurring grants for specified objects, the
order shall also specify the time limit within which the grant or each instalment of
it is to be spent.
(2) An order for payment of a grant-in-aid should be so worded that there is
a specific direction for the payment of a specified sum and should be distinguishable
from orders approving a proposal for a grant-in-aid.
112. Grants should be made available, as far as possible, on the basis of specified
schemes drawn up in sufficient detail and duly approved by Government.
113. (1) When recurring grants-in-aid are sanctioned to the same institution
for the same purpose, a certificate to the effect that the unspent balance of the
previous grant has either been surrendered to Government or has been taken into
account in sanctioning the subsequent grant should be incorporated in the sanction
letter in such cases.
(2) Only so much of the grant shall be paid during any financial year as is
likely to be expended during that year. In the case of grants for specific works or
services such as buildings or other schemes the sanctioning authority shall use its
discretion in authorising payments according to the needs of the work. It should be
ensured that money is not drawn in advance of requirements and that a rush of
payment of these grants in March is avoided.
Note 1:- Grant-in-aid in excess of Rs. 1 lakh per annum recurring and Rs.5
lakhs non-recurring should normally be sanctioned with the specific conditions
laid down in the sanction letters that the accounts of the institution receiving the
grant should be open for test check by the Comptroller and Auditor General at his
discretion. The audit in pursuance of this provision will be undertaken by the
Comptroller and Auditor General in consultation with the administrative
department concerned which will make necessary arrangements with the institutions
for the conduct of such audit.
42
Note 2 : The Comptroller and Auditor General may, at his discretion,
approach the Government when in any very special case he considers that the
audit of the grantee’s books, even where the grant is less than the monetary limits
prescribed above, is called for.
Note 3 : When an institution receiving a grant is required to submit its
accounts for audit it should be ensured by the sanctioning authority that the
accounts whether complete or not are rendered promptly, whenever the institution
is called upon to do so.
114. Institutions or bodies receiving grants exceeding Rs.1 lakh per annum
recurring or Rs.5 lakhs non-recurring should be required to maintain subsidiary
accounts of the Government grants and be to furnish to the Accountant General-
(i)
a copy of the audited statement of its accounts; and
(ii)
a copy of their constitution.
115. In case in which conditions are attached to the utilisation of a grant in the form
of specification of particular objects or expenditure or the time within which the
money must be spent, or otherwise, the sanctioning authority shall be primarily
responsible for certifying to the Accountant General, where necessary, the
fulfillment of the conditions attaching to the grant, unless there is any special rule
or order to the contrary. This certificate should be furnished in such form and at
such intervals as may be agreed between the Accountant General and the head of
the department concerned. Before recording the certificate, the certifying officer
should take steps to satisfy himself that the conditions on which the grant was
sanctioned have been or are being fulfilled.
116 (1) Unless it is otherwise ordered by Government, every grant made for a
specific object is subject to the implied conditions -
(i)
that the grant shall be spent upon the object within a reasonable
time, if no time limit has been fixed by the sanctioning authority ;
and
(ii)
that any portion of the amount which is not ultimately required for
expenditure upon that object shall be duly surrendered to
Government.
(2) Even in respect of unconditional grant-in-aid, Government reserve the
right to have the accounts of the recipient body audited by the Comptroller and
Auditor General on their own initiative, if and when occasion demands, to satisfy
themselves regarding the manner in which the affairs of the recipient body are
managed.
43
Note - The expression ‘within a reasonable time’ used in sub-rule (i) above
should ordinarily be interpreted to mean one year from the date of issue of the
letter sanctioning the grant.
III. LOCAL BODIES
117. The financial transactions between Government and local bodies will be
regulated by the following rules and by such other general or special orders as may
be issued by Government in this behalf.
118. Any amount due to Government by a local body, including any amount
overdue for payment in respect of a loan, is subject to recovery by adjustment
from any non-statutory grant sanctioned for payment to it.
119. Audit of accounts :- The accounts of local bodies other non-Government
bodies or institutions will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of
India on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Government
and the Comptroller & Auditor General.
44
CHAPTER X
STORES
I. GENERAL RULES
120. The term “stores” used in this chapter applies generally to all articles and
materials purchased or otherwise acquired for the use of a department including not
only expendable and issueable articles in use or accumulated for specific
purposes, but also articles of dead stock of the nature of plant, machinery,
instruments, furniture, equipment, fixtures, etc.
121. These rules are generally applicable to all departments. These shall be applied
on conjunction with special rules which may be existing or may be made for
particular departments, e.g., S.P.W.D. Irrigation, Power, Forest and S.N.T, etc.
122. Periodical indents should be prepared and all purchase of stores should be
made in the most economical manner in accordance with the definite requirements
of the public service. Care should be taken not to purchase stores much in advance
of actual requirements, if such purchases are likely to prove unprofitable to
Government. At the same time, where materials are scarce and controlled and
receipt through Government channels may take an appreciable time, indents should
be placed sufficiently in advance so as to ensure that developmental projects are
not delayed.
123. Where scales of use or limits of stores have been laid down, the officer
ordering a supply should certify on the purchase order that the prescribed scales or
limits are not exceeded.
124.Purchase orders should not be split up to avoid the necessity for
obtaining the sanction of the higher authority required with reference to the total
amount of the orders.
II. PURCHASE OF STORES.
125. Local purchase of stores may normally be made -
(i)
when the requirement is immediate;
(ii)
when the requirement is of such minor magnitude and no bulk central
purchase arrangement exists or is warranted; and
(iii)
the expenditure involved does not exceed Rs.20,000 at a time.
45
126. Purchases should conform to the following procedure:-
(i)
In case of purchases costing less than Rs.10000 at a time, after
reasonable market enquiry.
(ii)
For purchase costing Rs.10000 to Rs.20,000 by direct invitation of
rates from a reasonable number of reliable firms.
(iii)
For purchase costing over Rs.20,000 normally through the State
Trading Corporation of Sikkim.
Note : In exceptional cases of urgency, direct purchases may be made with
the specific prior approval of the Finance Department.
127. When stores are purchased from the open market directly the system of open
competitive tender should, as far as possible, be adopted. In the case of all
purchases of stores costing more than Rs. 10,00,000/- ( Rupees ten lakh) only whether
to be purchased through STCS or direct, open tenders (through advertisement) should
be invited giving wide publicity in the leading newspapers at least a month before the
last date of submission of tenders. All such tenders should be opened at Gangtok by a
Tender Selection Committee of five, which should have one member from the
department concerned, one from Finance and one from State Trading Corporation and
such other members as the Government may decide. The tenders should be accepted
only on the recommendations of the Tender Selection Committee. For other purchases
costing not more then rupee one lakh, whether made direct by the department or by
STCS, the sealed tenders/quotation through advertisement in local papers should be
invited. The tenders/quotations should be opened at a given time and place in the
presence of tenderers as far as possible, by a Departmental purchase Committee,
consisting of at least three officers appointed by the Head of Department
concerned/Managing Director, STCS, which should include the Accounts Officer or
any other officer of the Department dealing with accounts.
128. For purchase of goods of value exceeding Rs.20,000 tenderers should
normally be required to furnish a security deposit of such amounts as may be
considered adequate by the indenting authority with the approval of Government.
129. While inviting tenders, time limits for the completion of the supplies to be
ordered, should invariably be indicated.
130. Comparative statements of tenders/quotations should be prepared in all cases
where tenders/quotations are called for. In addition, the following points should
be observed:-
(i)
The rates should be inclusive of packing and forwarding charges; or
such charges should be quoted separately.
46
(ii)
Wherever possible, rates should be F.O.R. destination.
(iii)
The quotations or tenders should specify whether the rates are
inclusive or exclusive of sales tax and other levies.
Note : Ordinarily goods should be booked by rail at goods rate and for the
transport by road, by the vehicles of the Sikkim Nationalised Transport. For
any other mode of transport, special sanction of Government will be necessary.
(iv)
From the nearest Railway station in India, goods will invariably be
carried by the Sikkim Nationalised Transport or under arrangements
authorised by it.
(v)
Transit risks to the place from delivery from suppliers outside Sikkim
should be covered by insurance where ever considered necessary.
Such insurance shall ordinarily be required to be taken by the supplier.
(vi)
For purchasing high value plant, machinery, etc. of complex and
technical nature, bids may be obtained in two parts as under:-
(a) Technical bid consisting of all technical details along with
commercial terms and conditions; and
(b) Financial bid indicating item-wise price for the items mentioned in
the technical bid.
The technical bid and financial bid should be sealed by the bidder in
separate covers duly superscribed and both the bids sealed in single
cover duly superscribed to be opened by the Purchase Committee. Late
bids received after the specified date and time fixed for receipt of the
bids shall not be considered.

ANNEXURE
( See rule 127 )
The Public Accounts Committee 1977-78 in their first report on the accounts of
Electricity (Power) Department has observed: The Committee feels that to avoid
malpractices, contracts for purchase/supply should be with registered and reputed
firms only. The Committee recommends that in future all purchases over rupees one
lakh or any specified amount as may be fixed by the Government, may be made on
the basis of open tenders invited at Gangtok after giving wide publicity in the local
and national news papers at least a month before the last date of submission of
tenders except in cases of emergent purchase the reasons for which should be
recorded in writing by the competent authority. All such tenders should be opened at
Gangtok by a Committee of five, which should have one member from the
department concerned, one from Finance and State Trading Corporation each and
such other members as the Government may decide.
2. The P.A.C. (1978-79) in their second report has further observed: In reply
to a query made by the Committee, the Department (Power) admitted that it had not
so far initiated any proposal for constitution of such a committee. The committee
finds this apathy toward the Committee’s recommendations to be highly deplorable
and recommends that immediate steps should be taken for constitution of such a
committee under proper orders of the Government not only for the Department of
Power but also for all the other major purchasing departments.
3. The Committee also recommended that recommendations made in regard
51
to Power Department regarding procedure to be followed in inviting tenders and
assessment and acceptance should be made applicable in the case of State Trading
Corporation also.
4. Accordingly the matter was examined by the Government and it has been
decided that the procedure set out in the succeeding paragraphs should be followed in
the case of all purchases by the departments including the State Trading Corporation
of Sikkim with immediate effect.
TENDERS
5. In the case of all purchases of stores costing more than Rs.1,00,000 (Rs.
one lakh) whether to be purchased through S.T.C. or direct, open tenders (through
advertisement) should be invited giving wide publicity in the leading newspapers at
least a month before the last date of submission of tenders. All such tenders should
be opened at Gangtok by a Tender Selection Committee of five, which should have
one member from the department concerned, one from Finance and State Trading
Corporation each and such other members as the Government may decide. The
tenders should be accepted only on the recommendations of the Tender Selection
Committee.
6. For other purchases costing not more than rupees one lakh, whether made
direct by the department or by S.T.C., the sealed tenders/quotations through
advertisement in local papers should be invited. In this connection reference to
instructions contained in Finance Department Notification No.11/Fin dated 21.10.76
is also invited. The tenders/quotations should be opened at a given time and place in
the presence of tenders as far as possible, by a Departmental Purchase Committee,
consisting of at least three officers appointed by the head of the department
concerned/ Managing Director of S.T.C. which should include the Accounts Officer
or any other officer of the department dealing with account.
7. For materials available at D.G.S & D. rate contract, no tenders may be
necessary. Firms holding D.G.S.& D. rate contract may be registered with State
Trading Corporation who may procure the materials at the D.G.S. & D. rate contract
from such firms. No such procurement should, however, be made from the agents of
the D.G.S. & D. rate contract holding firms. Similarly procedure may be followed
for articles which are specially certified as of proprietary nature or when it is clear
that only a particular firm is the manufacture of the stores required.
(Government of Sikkim instruction) Not. No. 45/Fin/Adm dated 9.12.97
1.1 Matters relating to procurement of store items form the authorised dealers/
manufacturers on tender basis, the provision of the annexure to Rule 127 of
Sikkim Financial Rules, 1979, is mandatory. Of late it has been brought to the
notice of the Government that provisions contained in the said annexure and Rule
128 to 132 are also not complied with causing dissatisfaction of dealers/
companies in not getting sufficient time for them to participate in the tender/
52
quotation. To maintain not only the standard in quality and cost of items, but also
to obtain most competative rates, the participation of maximum number of tenders
in imperative and also to have transparency in the mode of transaction must
confirm with laid down rules and procedures.
1.2 It is, therefore, directed that the following directives be followed to avoid the
above stated lapses:-
(a) Minimum time for tender notice in national papers, on no account, be less than
30 days form the date of issue of notice inviting tender.
(b) Preference may be given to the manufacturers and agencies holding rate
contract with D.G.S. & D.
(c) In the notice inviting tender it may invariably be mentioned that tender/
quotation will also be received by registered post and considered, if received
on or before the appointed date and time. The authority inviting
tender/quotation shall not be responsible for late receipt due to postal delay.
INSPECTION AND TEST
8. For materials procured not at D.G.S. & D. rate contract, inspection
should be carried by an officer of the indenting department nominated by the head of
the department before despatch commences from supplier’s premises.
9. The above procedure shall be followed in case of all purchases whether
made direct by the department under specific orders of the competent
authority or through State Trading Corporation of Sikkim under the
existing orders. The State Trading Corporation of Sikkim shall also adopt
the above procedure mutatis mutandis.
52
CHAPTER XI
WORKS
139. The execution of works by the Sikkim Public Works, Irrigation, Power, Rural
Development and Forest Departments shall be regulated by the specific rules and
procedure applicable to them with such modifications as may be approved by
Government from time to time. The following general principles shall, however,
apply to the execution of all works.
140. General rules - (1) Except as provided in sub-rule (2) of this rule or in cases
covered by any special rules or orders of Government, no work shall be commenced
or liability incurred in connection with it until-
(i)
administrative approval had been obtained from the authority
appropriate in each case;
(ii)
Sanction to incur expenditure has been obtained from the competent
authority;
(iii)
a properly detailed design and estimate has been sanctioned; and
(iv)
funds to cover the charge during the year have been provided by
competent authority.
(2) If, in any case, whether on grounds of urgency or otherwise, an
executive officer is required by superior authority to carry out a work or incur a
liability which involves an infringement of sub-rule (1) above, the orders of such
authority shall be conveyed in writing. On receipt of such written order, or in cases
of emergency, on his own responsibility, the officer may proceed to carry out the
necessary work subject to the condition that he immediately intimates to the said
superior authority the liability he is incurring stating approximately the amount
of the liability which he is likely to incur and requesting for formal sanction of the
competent authority.
141. For purpose of approval and sanctions, a group of works which forms one
project, should be considered as one work, and the necessity for obtaining the
approval or sanction of higher authority to a project which consists of such a
group of works is not avoided by any fact that the cost of each particular work in the
project is within the powers of approval or sanction of any authority subordinate
thereto.
53
142. The sanction given to an estimate must on all occasions be looked upon as
strictly limited by the precise objects for which the estimate was intended to provide.
Accordingly, any anticipated or actual savings on a sanctioned estimate for a
definite project should not, without special authority, be applied to carry out
additional work not contemplated in the original project or fairly contingent on
its actual execution.
143. Any development of a project thought necessary while a work is in
progress, which is not fairly contingent on the proper execution of the work as first
sanctioned, should be covered by a supplementary estimate.
144. To facilitate the preparation of estimates, as also serve as a guide in settling
rates in connection with contract agreements, a schedule of rates for each kind of work
commonly executed should be maintained for each locality and kept up to date.
The rates entered in the estimates should generally agree with the schedule rates, but
where, for any cause, these are considered insufficient or in excess, a detailed
statement must be given in the report accompanying the estimate, showing the
manner in which the rates used in the estimate are arrived at.
145. When works are given out on contract, the general principles laid down in rule 27
shall be carefully borne in mind.
146. When works allotted to a civil department other than the Sikkim Public Works
Department are executed departmentally, whether direct or through contractors,
the form and procedure relating to expenditure on such works shall be prescribed
by departmental regulations in consultation with the Finance Department and the
Accountant General, generally on the principles underlying the financial and
accounting rules prescribed for similar works carried out by the Sikkim Public
Works Department. The guiding principles to be followed in such cases are —
(i)
for every work there should be a duly sanctioned detailed estimate;
copies of sanctions to estimate should be communicated to the
Accountant general and the Chief Pay and Accounts Officer by the
sanctioning authority as soon as a sanction is accorded; and
(ii)
payments for all works done by contract or materials purchased
should be made on the basis of measurements recorded in
Measurement Books kept for the purpose.
147. Advances to contractors - As a general rule, and subject to such exceptions as
may be authorised by Government, no payment can be made to a contractor, except
for work actually done or supplies actually received. Subject to such general or
special orders as may be issued by Government in this behalf, advances, if any, made
to contractors during the execution of a work shall invariably be recovered from
their bills for the value of work done or supplies made before final payment is
made, which must in no case be permitted without detailed measurement.
54
However it may become necessary to make some advance payment to original
manufacturers of equipments, firms holding maintenance contracts with the
Government for servicing of office equipment or part payment to be made to suppliers
depending on the terms & conditions incorporated in a supply order. In such cases,
advance payment may be permitted not exceeding the following limits:-
(i) Thirty percent of the total value of the supply order to original manufacturer of
equipments. (ii) Fifty percent of the total value of the supply order to a State or
Central Government Agency or a Public Sector Undertaking. (iii) Fifty percent of the
total value of the Annual Maintenance Contract for maintenance of Office Equipment.
54
CHAPTER XII
LOANS TO LOCAL BODIES AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
148. (1) A competent authority may sanction loans to local bodies and private
individuals for the purpose and subject to the conditions that may be prescribed by
Government from time to time. An order for payment of a loan should clearly
specify whether it is a sanction for payment or merely an order approving a
proposal for loan.
(2) In cases in which conditions are attached to the utilisation of loan,
either in the shape of the specification of the particular objects on which or the time
within which the money must be spent, or otherwise, the authority competent to
sanction the loan shall be primarily responsible for certifying to the Accountant
General, where necessary, the fulfillment of the conditions attaching to the loan,
unless there is any special rule or order to the contrary.
149. (1) In all cases of loans which the Government may decide to grant, the terms
under which such loans are granted should be covered by a deed to be executed
by the loanee and the deed shall ordinarily include -
(i)
a fixed rate of interest to be paid not less often than yearly;
(ii)
a fixed or proportionate scale of repayment in installment not less
often than yearly;
(iii)
the date from which repayment shall commence and the head of
account to which the repayments shall be credited;
(iv)
hypothecation to the Government of security of such value as
the Government may consider adequate; and
(v)
provision for penalties in the event of delay or default in fulfilling
the terms of the loan, one of the penalties invariably being
recovery through disposal of the hypothecated security.
(2) With the previous consent of the Finance Department Government
may remit or write off any loan owing to their recovery or otherwise.
(3)
Subject to such general or specific directions as may be given by the
Comptroller & Auditor General in this behalf, detailed accounts of loans to
institutions and organisations’ etc. shall be maintained by the Accountant General
55
who shall watch their recovery and see that the conditions attached to each loan are
fulfilled. This shall not however, absolve the departmental authorities of their
responsibility to see that recoveries of installments are made regularly and that the
conditions of loans are fulfilled.
(4)
In the case of loans to private individuals, the detailed accounts
shall be maintained by the departmental authorities concerned who shall also
watch their recovery and see that the conditions attached to each loans are fulfilled.

by the disbursing officers.
7. Supplementary estimates for all expenditure financed from the Fund shall be
presented to the legislature at the earliest opportunity. Such an estimate can either
be for the amount equal to the full estimated expenditure for which an advance has been
made from the Fund or for a reduced sum owing to certain savings being available
within the grant or charged appropriation concerned or because of the estimate
of expenditure at the time of sanctioning an advance having been subsequently found
to be in excess of requirements or for a token sum only where expenditure involved
can be met entirely by savings in the grant or charged appropriation concerned.
Note I.- While presenting to the State Legislature, supplementary estimates
for expenditure financed from the Fund, a note to the following effect shall be made
in the explanatory memoranda relating to such estimates:
“A sum of Rs........has been advanced from the Sikkim Contingency Fund and an
equivalent amount is required to enable repayment to be made to that Fund” .
Note 2.- If any new expenditure or expenditure on a new service or scheme not
contemplated in the annual financial statement for which an advance from the
Contingency Fund has been sanctioned can be met wholly or partly from savings
available within the authorised appropriation, the note appended to the estimate
submitted shall be in the following form:-
“ The expenditure is on a new item or service or scheme. A sum of Rs.......has
been advanced from the Contingency Fund and an equivalent amount is
required to enable repayment to be made to that Fund. The amount, namely
Rs...........can be found by re-appropriation of savings within the
grant/charged appropriation and a token vote only is now required/vote is
required for the balance, that is Rs.................only” .
8. If, in any case, after the order sanctioning an advance from the Contingency
Fund has been issued in accordance with rule 5 and before action is taken in
accordance with Rule 7, it is found that the advance sanctioned will remain wholly
or partly unutilised, an application shall be made to the sanctioning authority for
canceling or modifying the sanction, as the case may be.
9. All advances sanctioned from the Contingency Fund to meet the expenditure
in excess of the provision for any service included in an Appropriation (Vote on
Account) Act shall be recouped to the Fund as soon as the Appropriation Act in respect
of the expenditure on the service for the whole year, including the excess met from
the advances from the Fund, has been passed.
10. As soon as the State Legislature has authorised the expenditure by including
it in a Supplementary Appropriation Act, the advance made from the Fund shall be
recouped to the Fund and necessary adjustment made in the accounts.
11. As soon as the advance made from the Contingency Fund has been recouped
to the Fund, consequent on the enactment of the Appropriation Act, the Finance
Department shall inform the Accountant General about it, indicating the number and date
of the order under which the original advance was made. A copy of the Appropriation
Act shall be forwarded.
12. The heads of departments/offices shall maintain a separate record of all
transactions connected with the expenditure out of the advances from the Contingency
Fund in the same form or forms as are used for the maintenance of records of
expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund and in similar details in respect of major and
minor heads and units of appropriation as would have been operated upon had the
expenditure been incurred out of the Consolidated Fund . The form or forms referred
to above, may however, be so amplified as to enable the disbursing officers to keep a
close watch on the progress of expenditure from and out of individual advances from the
Fund as also to keep a record of the details in respect of recoupment, when made, of
those advances to the Fund.
13. An account of the transactions of the Fund shall be maintained by the
Finance Department in a separate register in the form annexed to these rules.
14. Actual expenditure incurred against advances from the Contingency
Fund shall be recorded in the account relating to the Contingency Fund in the same
details as it would have been shown if it had been paid out of the Consolidated Fund.

No 7/Fin
Dated 19.3.1979
Subject : Purchase of newspapers, periodicals, magazines.
One of the generally recognised canons of financial propriety is that the
funds allotted to appending units are expended only in the public interest and upon
objected for which the money was provided. It is in the responsibility of every
Government officer to ensure that no unnecessary expenditure is incurred.
2.
It has, however, come to notice that some of the departments/offices are
contributing to a number of newspapers, periodicals, magazines, etc., at public in
expenses, most of which have no relevance to the functioning of the departments /
offices and, therefore, cannot be said as serving any public interest. This is no doubt a
very unhappy position.
3.
The heads of departments/offices are, therefore, requested to review the
position obtaining in their departments/offices and to take immediate steps to
discontinue forthwith all periodicals and magazines which do not serve any public
interest. It should suffice if head of the department contributes to only one newspaper of
all India circulation if considered necessary, and only such periodicals which are
directly related to the functioning of his department. This is necessary to observe almost
economy in every field of administration.

Subject: Printing & Stationery Articles.
It has been brought to the notice of the Government that a number of Departments are
indenting stationery items such as Cash books, Salary Audit Registers, Contingent Bill
Registers etc from private presses without being aware that these articles are available with the
Printing Department. This has not only resulted in non-utilisation of readily available stock
with the Printing Department but has also led to non-uniformity of the forms and registers in
terms of size, volume and design.
In order to bring about standardisation of the forms and registers commonly used by the
departments it has been decided in consultation with the Printing Department to lay down
specifications of various stationery articles shown in the enclosed annexure. User departments
are requested to henceforth comply with specifications and also ensure that procurement of
these articles is made from the Printing Department only.
It has also been brought to the notice of the Government that printing bills are being
entertained by some departments without prior verification by the Printing Department. This is
in contravention of the procedure laid down vide Circular No.18/Fin dated 29.9.83.
Departments are requested to strictly adhere to the procedures laid down by the Government

Sub:
Recording correct and complete Accounts Classification on bills.
Attention is invited once again to Rule 32(V)of the Sikkim Financial
Rules,1979 under which it is required that full accounts classification should be recorded
on each bill by the Drawing Officer. The classification in the budget book (Demand for
Grants) should be taken as guide and should also show whether the Expenditure is voted
or changed and plan or non-plan. During the course of compilation of monthly accounts,
it has been observed that wrong, incomplete and incorrect classification have been given
by the departments at the time of preparation of bills and no check seems to have been
exercised by the Drawing Officers before signing the bills inspite of our repeated
instructions.
Due to this type of persistent irregularities, the office of the Chief Pay &
accounts Officer (Compilation Section) as well as office of the Accountant General are
bound to book the expenditure figures not only to the incorrect head of accounts but
some time in the heads as wrongly given in vouchers with nil budget provisions. Such
expenditure is at times kept under suspension or O.B. for want of correct classification,
which causes major differences in departmental figures and compilation figures leading
to adverse comments in appropriation accounts.
As such all the Drawing & Disbursing Officers are directed to exercise strict
check for coding the proper classification at the time of preparation of bills and at the
same time the Chief Pay & Accounts Officer is .also advised to ensure strict compliance
of the above instructions before passing any bills.

Subject : Simplification of adjustment on account of pay and T.A. advance on transfer -
Avoidance of Inter Govt. settlement.
Under the provisions of Article - 36(b) (ii) of Accounts Code Volume I, in cases of
transfer of Government servants from ono Government to another, travelling allowances (both
ways) are borne by the borrowing Government and the advance of pay, if drawn, is accounted
for in the books of the Government to which the official proceeds on transfer.
2.
The existing procedure involves settlement of inter-State transactions with its attendant
complication of operation of suspense heads, issuance of cheques, bank reconciliation etc. In
order to avoid such inter-governmental settlements, the Government of India, in consultation
with State Governments, has now decided that in case of transfer of a Government Servant from
one Government to another, any advance towards pay / T.A. paid by lending Government would
be finally booked as revenue expenditure in its own books. Recovery / adjustment of these
advances from the Government servant’s pay/T.A. bills will be watched through last pay
certificate and credit / net debit would be accounted for in the books of the borrowing
Government Servant reverts to the parent Government.
3.
3.
In all cases of transfer of Government Servants between two Governments, whether for
proceeding on deputation or on reversion taking place or on after 1.1.1987, settlement of
advances of pay and T.A. will be in accordance with these orders, (Based on Ministry of
