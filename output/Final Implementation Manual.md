financial year and place before the Gram Sabha after the Annual State Budget is passed by the State
LegislativeAssembly.
8.2 BudgetsReflecttheWishofthePeople:
The concept of Panchayati Raj is about transferring power to the people. It is based on Gandhiji's
cherished vision of 'self-governing' villages. Villages have to be self-sufficient and be able to chalk out their own
agenda for development depending on the local needs. However, villages have only limited resources and a
prudentuseofthesescarceresourcescanbemadeonlythroughaneffectiveexerciseofbudgeting.

Panchayats are responsible for identifying development works based on suggestions made by various members
of the Gram Sabha. These works may be in various areas where the State has issued orders for devolution of
power to the Panchayats. Identifying different works based on the need of the people and in the form of
development projects in the area of jurisdiction of the Gram Panchayat and estimating the likely expenditure

administration of the Panchayat, are continuous and the panchayat has to find adequate funding for these

activities. These would form the first charge on the available resources of the Panchayats. There may be
manyotheritemsof activities or works based on suggestions received from the people on which the
expenditure is required to be incurred from the available funds of the Panchayats. As the resources are
limited, this would require setting up a criteria for determining as to what all works/activities should be taken

authority will evaluate the estimates of possible revenues and proposals of expenditures. There may be further

In case expenditure is not provided for in the budget or there is a need to incur more funds than

approved in the next immediate meeting of the Gram Sabha. The revised budget estimate is presented in the
month of February - March or as per the need of Gram Panchayat, or as part of the budget proposals for the
succeedingyear.

9. MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS
9.1 The provisions relating to Accounts and Audit and other related issues are contained in Sikkim
Panchayat Act, 1993 in section 48 in respect of Gram Panchayat requiring maintenance of accounts of receipt
andexpenditureinsuchformandmannerasmaybeprescribed.
9.2 Budgetsconveyapprovalforspendingwithintheapprovedlimit
Budgets convey approval of the Gram Panchayat for spending funds on the approved works/activities.
Expenditure on the approved works/activities have to be contained within the estimated amount, and if
not further approval is required. The Sabhapati and Gram Sachiva are authorized to sign cheques for
withdrawing money from the banks for meeting an intended expenditure. However, this power can be
exercised onlyif fundsareavailabletobespenton thatparticularwork/activity. Thisisachievedthrough
accounting.While incurring expenditure a record of expenditure is kept what is called a ‘Voucher’. Data
contained on these vouchers are recorded in various books like cash book, Contingent Audit
Register/LedgerAccounts,registerofworks,DemandandCollectionRegister,etc.
9.3 WhatisAccounting?
Accounting is a process of recognizing, measuring and generating of financial information to permit
informed judgments and decisions by the users of accounts. Each Gram Panchayat is an entity which
receives and pays money from and to a number of other entities or individuals. It is important that all
these money received or spent should be recorded properly so that it should be possible at any future
date to know what has been received from whom on what account or what has been paid towhom and
why.
An entity should be seen differently from the individuals who run it. The money received by Gram
Panchayat does not belong to any individual but to the Panchayat as a whole. No individual can spend

9.4 AccountsofGramPanchayats
Since the accounts of Gram Panchayats in many cases are maintained on cash basis and transactions

automaticallycoveredbycashsystem ofaccounts. Withtheincreasinguseof InformationTechnologyin
maintenance of accounts, some of these Books of Accounts may not be maintained at all as the
computers can process theinformationand produce the desired reportsby aggregating theinformation.
For less complex accounts like that of a Gram Panchayat, documents like Ledger Books can be
processed by computer. In other words, it should be possible that by entering the basic data which

NOTE:
1) WhendoesaccountingbeginincaseofPRIs?
After the completion of process of budgeting, approval and sanctioning of budget estimates, the
processof implementationof budgetestimatesstartsandwiththistheprocessofaccountingbeginsas
explainedbelow.
The process of implementation of budget estimates will involve emergence of financial
transactions affecting the flow of money into the funds of the concerned PRI from various sources of
receipts as visualized in the budget estimates. Similarly, there will also be flow of money out of the
funds on account of expenses on various activities as per the estimates anticipated in the budget
estimates. Thus, funds of the concerned PRI will either increase or decrease with every financial
transactionof receiptorpayment respectively.Therefore, it isnecessarythateverysuchtransactionas
